 * A write on a document.
 *
 * @property {Object} update
 *   A document to write.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Document]{@link
 * google.firestore.v1beta1.Document}
 *
 * @property {string} delete
 *   A document name to delete. In the format:
 *   `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}`.
 *
 * @property {Object} transform
 *   Applies a tranformation to a document.
 *   At most one `transform` per document is allowed in a given request.
 *   An `update` cannot follow a `transform` on the same document in a given
 *   request.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [DocumentTransform]{@link
 * google.firestore.v1beta1.DocumentTransform}
 *
 * @property {Object} updateMask
 *   The fields to update in this write.
 *
 *   This field can be set only when the operation is `update`.
 *   If the mask is not set for an `update` and the document exists, any
 *   existing data will be overwritten.
 *   If the mask is set and the document on the server has fields not covered by
 *   the mask, they are left unchanged.
 *   Fields referenced in the mask, but not present in the input document, are
 *   deleted from the document on the server.
 *   The field paths in this mask must not contain a reserved field name.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [DocumentMask]{@link
 * google.firestore.v1beta1.DocumentMask}
 *
 * @property {Object} currentDocument
 *   An optional precondition on the document.
 *
 *   The write will fail if this is set and not met by the target document.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Precondition]{@link
 * google.firestore.v1beta1.Precondition}

     *   The path of the field. See Document.fields for the field path syntax

     *   Sets the field to the given server value.

     * @property {Object} increment
     *   Adds the given value to the field's current value.
     *
     *   This must be an integer or a double value.
     *   If the field is not an integer or double, or if the field does not yet
     *   exist, the transformation will set the field to the given value.
     *   If either of the given value or the current field value are doubles,
     *   both values will be interpreted as doubles. Double arithmetic and
     *   representation of double values follow IEEE 754 semantics.

     *   This must be an integer or a double value.
     *   If the field is not an integer or double, or if the field does not yet
     *   exist, the transformation will set the field to the given value.
     *   If a maximum operation is applied where the field and the input value
     *   are of mixed types (that is - one is an integer and one is a double)
     *   the field takes on the type of the larger operand. If the operands are
     *   equivalent (e.g. 3 and 3.0), the field does not change.
     *   0, 0.0, and -0.0 are all zero. The maximum of a zero stored value and
     *   zero input value is always the stored value.
     *   The maximum of any numeric value x and NaN is NaN.

     * @property {Object} minimum
     *   Sets the field to the minimum of its current value and the given value.
     *
     *   This must be an integer or a double value.
     *   If the field is not an integer or double, or if the field does not yet
     *   exist, the transformation will set the field to the input value.
     *   If a minimum operation is applied where the field and the input value
     *   are of mixed types (that is - one is an integer and one is a double)
     *   the field takes on the type of the smaller operand. If the operands are
     *   equivalent (e.g. 3 and 3.0), the field does not change.
     *   0, 0.0, and -0.0 are all zero. The minimum of a zero stored value and
     *   zero input value is always the stored value.
     *   The minimum of any numeric value x and NaN is NaN.

     * @property {Object} appendMissingElements
     *   Append the given elements in order if they are not already present in
     *   the current field value.
     *   If the field is not an array, or if the field does not yet exist, it is
     *   first set to the empty array.
     *
     *   Equivalent numbers of different types (e.g. 3L and 3.0) are
     *   considered equal when checking if a value is missing.
     *   NaN is equal to NaN, and Null is equal to Null.
     *   If the input contains multiple equivalent values, only the first will
     *   be considered.
     *
     *   The corresponding transform_result will be the null value.
