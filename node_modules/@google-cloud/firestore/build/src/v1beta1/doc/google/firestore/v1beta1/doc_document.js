/**
 * A Firestore document.
 *
 * Must not exceed 1 MiB - 4 bytes.
 *
 * @property {string} name
 *   The resource name of the document, for example
 *   `projects/{project_id}/databases/{database_id}/documents/{document_path}`.
 *
 * @property {Object.<string, Object>} fields
 *   The document's fields.
 *
 *   The map keys represent field names.
 *
 *   A simple field name contains only characters `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z`,
 *   `0` to `9`, or `_`, and must not start with `0` to `9`. For example,
 *   `foo_bar_17`.
 *
 *   Field names matching the regular expression `__.*__` are reserved. Reserved
 *   field names are forbidden except in certain documented contexts. The map
 *   keys, represented as UTF-8, must not exceed 1,500 bytes and cannot be
 *   empty.
 *
 *   Field paths may be used in other contexts to refer to structured fields
 *   defined here. For `map_value`, the field path is represented by the simple
 *   or quoted field names of the containing fields, delimited by `.`. For
 *   example, the structured field
 *   `"foo" : { map_value: { "x&y" : { string_value: "hello" }}}` would be
 *   represented by the field path `foo.x&y`.
 *
 *   Within a field path, a quoted field name starts and ends with `` ` `` and
 *   may contain any character. Some characters, including `` ` ``, must be
 *   escaped using a `\`. For example, `` `x&y` `` represents `x&y` and
 *   `` `bak\`tik` `` represents `` bak`tik ``.
 *
 * @property {Object} createTime
 *   Output only. The time at which the document was created.
 *
 *   This value increases monotonically when a document is deleted then
 *   recreated. It can also be compared to values from other documents and
 *   the `read_time` of a query.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Timestamp]{@link
 * google.protobuf.Timestamp}
 *
 * @property {Object} updateTime
 *   Output only. The time at which the document was last changed.
 *
 *   This value is initially set to the `create_time` then increases
 *   monotonically with each change to the document. It can also be
 *   compared to values from other documents and the `read_time` of a query.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Timestamp]{@link
 * google.protobuf.Timestamp}
 *
 * @typedef Document
 * @memberof google.firestore.v1beta1
